# Djowda Intelligent Cell Glossary
A curated glossary of terms used across the Djowda Intelligent Cell (DIC) architecture, protocols, testing framework, and data flow cycles.

---

## A

**Android Cell (DIC Instance)**  
A single, autonomous Android-based node in the Djowda ecosystem that participates in the LRS cycle. Each cell acts like a neuron — capable of learning, remembering, and sharing independently.

---

## B

**Broker (MQTT Broker)**
A message distribution service that routes MQTT messages between DIC cells. Examples include Mosquitto and EMQX.

---

## C

**Cell ID**
A unique identifier for each Djowda Intelligent Cell (DIC) instance, often referred to as `sourceId` in technical documentation and code. This ID is crucial for data attribution, authentication, message scoping, and trust mapping within the DIC network.

**CID (Content Identifier)**
A unique hash generated by IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) that acts as a permanent address for a piece of content. Djowda Intelligent Cells (DICs) use CIDs to reference and retrieve data snapshots stored on services like Web3.Storage.

**Conflict Resolution**
A rule-based process used when two or more cells push differing versions of the same data. May be resolved using timestamps, trust levels, or priorities.

---

## D

**Delta (Update)**
A lightweight data packet, typically shared via MQTT, that contains only the changes or updates to a Djowda Intelligent Cell's state, rather than its full state. This approach optimizes bandwidth usage during data synchronization.

**DIC (Djowda Intelligent Cell)**
A Djowda Intelligent Cell (DIC) is the core structural and smallest active unit in the Djowda ecosystem, typically running as an Android application instance. It is situated within a MinMax99 Grid cell, can host Djowda Components, processes LRS (Learn, Remember, Share) logic, and communicates with other cells and services via protocols like MQTT and IPFS (often through Web3.Storage).

**Djowda Components**
Functional software modules (e.g., store app, user app, delivery app, farmer app) that are hosted within a Djowda Intelligent Cell. Each component is designed to perform specific tasks and typically operates its own LRS Cycle.

---

## F

**Failsafe Verification**
A security mechanism that ensures a received message’s origin is valid and the data is schema-compliant.

## I

**IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**
A decentralized storage protocol used for persistent data sharing in the DIC network, especially for memory exports.

---

## L

**Learn (LRS)**
The stage where a DIC observes or receives new input data and parses it into local knowledge.

**Lobby**
A virtual, topic-based communication channel where a group of Djowda Intelligent Cells subscribe to the same MQTT topics. Lobbies facilitate targeted data exchange and collaboration among DICs relevant to a shared context, task, or geographical proximity.

**LRS Cycle**
The LRS Cycle is the core autonomous operational process of each Djowda Intelligent Cell, inspired by biological neurons. It consists of three distinct stages: **Learn** (ingesting data from various sources like local sensors, user inputs, or messages from other DICs), **Remember** (processing and persisting learned information, typically using local device storage like Room DB for immediate data and decentralized storage like IPFS/Web3.Storage for shareable snapshots), and **Share** (disseminating relevant information, such as data deltas or snapshot CIDs, to other DICs or services, primarily via MQTT).

---

## M

**MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)**
A lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol used by DIC cells for fast, asynchronous message passing.

**Message Queue**
Temporary storage for outgoing or incoming MQTT messages, used when offline or in flaky networks.

**MinMax99 Grid**
A deterministic geospatial framework that divides geographical areas into unique, typically 500m², cells based on GPS coordinates. Each Djowda Intelligent Cell (DIC) is precisely located within one of these grid cells, enabling location-based services, neighbor discovery, and geospatial awareness.

---

## R

**Remember (LRS)**
The stage where the DIC persists learned data locally using Room DB, and optionally summarizes it for sharing.

**Room DB**
Android's built-in SQLite abstraction used to store persistent local knowledge in each DIC.

---

## S

**Share (LRS)**
The stage where a DIC publishes learned and remembered data to external recipients via MQTT or IPFS.

**Snapshot**
A complete or partial export of a DIC’s internal state, typically used for syncing or historical auditing.

---

## T

**Trust Check**
The validation of an incoming message’s sender and data against a trusted cell list or cryptographic rules.

---

## U

**UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)**
Used to uniquely label messages, sessions, or data entities across the DIC ecosystem.

---

## V

**Versioning**
The practice of tagging data payloads with timestamps or version codes to manage updates, sync, and conflict resolution.

---

## W

**Web3.Storage**
A platform built on IPFS that allows DICs to upload and retrieve shared state data across the decentralized web.
